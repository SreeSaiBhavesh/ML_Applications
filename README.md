<li>Animal Classification</li>
<ul> <li>Animal Classification is classification of animals into their respective species, This was done by clustering in bottom up approach to find the type of animal from the 
classifications mentioned.</li></ul>

<li>Bike Predictor</li>
<ul><li>It was developed to predict the distance travelled by the bike from the given data to check the history of various bikes in future</li></ul>
<li>Breast Cancer Prediction</li>
<ul><li>Breast Cancer Prediction Was developed here with accuracy of 96%, The model is tested and it was giving good predictions mostly</li></ul>
<li>Churn Prediction</li>
<li>Movie recommendation</li>
<li>Video Game Sales Predictor</li>
